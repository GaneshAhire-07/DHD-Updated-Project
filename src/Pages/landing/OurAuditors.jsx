            <p>
              The Audit Committee is required to (pre-)approve the engagement
              for audit, audit-related and any other services of the Auditor by
              or any of its subsidiaries in order to assure that the performance
              of such services would not impair the Auditors’ independence from
              DHD. The Audit Committee will consider all services, either
              generally or individually pre-approved. The Audit Committee is
              also mindful of the proportion of aggregate fees for audit,
              audit-related and other services in deciding whether to approve
              such services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Appendices C and D to this Policy describe the services per type
              that have been generally pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The
              audit committee shall:

              </li>
              <li>Pre-approve the budget for each category of service.</li>
              <li>
                Specific pre-approval for the services exceeding the budgeted
                amount.
              </li>
              <li>

              For services that have to be individually pre-approved by the
              Audit Committee, the Group Controller of DHD will advise. DHD’s
              CFO may revise the lists of pre-approved services from time to
              time, based on subsequent determinations or changes in the
              requirements of applicable laws and regulations.

              The Auditor will provide the Audit Committee with a full overview
              of all services provided to DHD, including related fees and
              supported by sufficiently detailed information. This overview will
              be evaluated every second and fourth quarter by the Audit
              Committee. Throughout the year, the Auditor and DHD Finance will
              monitor the realization of the pre-approved budgeted amounts.
              Unused amounts in pre-approved budgets will not be carried forward
              to the next financial year. Following its Charter, the Audit
              Committee shall annually evaluate the performance of the Auditor,
              the scope of the audit(s) to be performed, and the independence of
              the Auditor, including considering whether the Auditors’ quality
              controls are adequate. DHD is required to adhere to the fee cap
              for non-audit services. This fee cap is limited to 70% of the
              average of the fees paid in the last three consecutive financial
              years for the audit. Group Finance is mandated to monitor all fees
              billed from DHD’s external auditor, provided that Group Finance’s
              monitoring of all fees billed from DHD’s external auditor shall
              not relieve the Audit Committee of its direct responsibilities
              relating to the compensation, retention and oversight of DHD’s
              external auditors.

              impair the Auditors’ independence and engagements for services
              entered under the pre-existing policy and in progress on 1 July
