          <p>
            DHD is governed by a Board of Directors which is made up of both
            Executive and Non Executive Directors. The independent Non-executive
            directors help to bring impartiality into the decision making
            process (the term Non Executive director refers to those members of
            the Board who are not part of the employed management team but who
            provide a range of skills and experience to the Board).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a clear division of responsibility between the running of
            the Board (the Chairman’s role) and leading the Executive team
            responsible for the running of the Society’s business (the Chief
            Executive’s role). This helps to ensure that no one individual has
            unfettered powers of decision-making and influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe an effective board should not necessarily be a
            comfortable place. There should not only be adequate independent
            challenge but also teamwork, both of which are critical features. A
            culture of openness and transparency is engendered by the Society
            and all Non Executive Directors are encouraged to meet with members
            of the Executive team and to develop their knowledge of the
            Society’s business.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of having a{" "}
            <strong>diverse Board</strong> which utilises a range of factors
            including skills, industry experience, background, race, gender and
            the other characteristics, experience and qualities of its
            Directors. Giving specific regard to gender ratios, there are{" "}
            <strong>two female directors</strong> on the Board. It is important
            to note that all Board appointments are made on the basis of
            individual competence, skills and expertise measured against
            identified objective criteria. Appointment is therefore based on
            merit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meetings take place on a monthly basis, or such other time as
            required, to carry out the Group’s business. The Board does not
            normally meet in August or December. The Board delegates a number of
            authorities to various Board Committees and Subsidiary Company
            Boards.
          </p>
          <p>
            In discharging its responsibilities to be accountable to the
            Society’s Members for the operation of the Society, the Board
            regards good corporate governance as extremely important. The

            The DHD Group has a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery of any
            kind within our operation. We all have a responsibility to be aware
            of the risks, however small in our business and wider supply chain.
            Colleagues are expected to report concerns, using appropriate
            reporting channels and management are expected to act upon them.

            Organisation's Structure
          </h3>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            The DHD Group consists of DHD and 2 key subsidiary companies:
            Newcastle Financial Advisers Limited and Newcastle Strategic
            Solutions Limited. The Society is the United Kingdom’s 8th largest
            building society and the largest building society in the North East
            of England. The DHD Group has 30 branches and employs in excess of
            1,000 staff across its branch network and head office sites.

            Our Business
          </h3>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            The DHD Group like all mutual organisations exists and functions for
            the benefit of its members, and so core to our vision is being a
            trusted provider of family savings, mortgages and financial advice
            delivered with good customer outcomes and great customer service.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            In addition, our subsidiary company Newcastle Strategic Solutions
            Limited is dedicated to the provision of outsourcing for financial
            services and provides system development and on-going operational
            support to both itself and the Society.

            Responsibilities

          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            The DHD Group’s board of directors has overall responsibility for
            ensuring our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking policy complies
            with our legal and ethical obligations, and that all those under our
            control comply with it. All our colleagues must observe our policy
            on Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking and be aware that turning a
            blind eye is unacceptable.

            Supply Chain Risk
          </h3>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            As the provider of financial services, the DHD Group is not in an
            industry with a high risk of modern day slavery and is not part of a
            supply chain, however in delivering our services, we procure goods
            and services from suppliers who do operate supply chains some of
            which are global. We have adopted a risk based approach to reviewing
            our supply chains which may carry a higher risk; these supply chains
            and suppliers which supply goods and/or services to us include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 mb-4 ml-4">
            <li>

            <li>Corporate hospitality.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            We manage these risk areas through our procedures set out in our
            Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking policy and elsewhere and we have
            not identified any evidenced reason to believe that slavery or human
            trafficking exists in the above currently.

            Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking
          </h3>

            We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or
            human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our
            business. Our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking policy reflects our
            commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our
            business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective
            systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not
            taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            Colleagues are able to report any suspicion of modern slavery or
            human trafficking under our Whistleblowing policy. This policy is to
            protect and support colleagues who make a non-malicious allegation
            in the best interests of the DHD Group, providing a confidential
            contact point and responding in an appropriate manner.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            Wherever possible we will seek to perform critical functions
            in-house and will only outsource functions where such arrangements
            will avoid undue conduct risk, operational risk, and reputational
            risk. Where we outsource functions, we perform due diligence on all
            outsourcing partners to satisfy ourselves of the robustness of
            outsourcing arrangements. This is fully documented under our
            Procurement & Supplier Management policy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            We tell companies we do business with that we are not prepared to
            accept any form of exploitation. Our Contracts policy advises that
            no agreements should be entered into by the Society which breach any
            law or regulation. The Contracts Policy also provides that any
            material contract must be reviewed by our Legal Services team prior
            to signature who will ensure there is a clause which obliges each
            party to comply with all applicable laws or regulations, in force
            from time to time.

              down through all layers of our supply chain, prohibits suppliers
