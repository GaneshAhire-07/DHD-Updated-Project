          <li>Sharing information across organizational boundaries should be facilitated where appropriate.</li>
          <li>A sustained data administration function should reinforce a set of definitions for commonly consumed data, with the understanding that there may be multiple valid definitions.</li>
          <li>Data integration across the DHD should be encouraged to foster data accuracy and uniformity, and demonstrate an understanding of DHD institutional complexity, various data systems, and differing data formats.</li>
          <li>Data should be safeguarded to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of personally identifiable information; such safeguards should be balanced and reflect the necessity for the DHD to conduct its business.</li>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Access to DHD data should be based on the business needs of the organization and should enhance the ability of the DHD to achieve its mission. Employees should have access to the data needed to perform their responsibilities, without regard to arbitrary barriers. In many cases, that data need not be individually identifiable. The DHD Data Warehouse should be built taking into account these constraints.

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Because no computer system is completely immune from exploitation, applying layered security controls will better safeguard DHD computers and DHD ever-expanding body of sensitive data/information.

          <li>Consult the "Related Policies" at the end of this policy for further information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Beyond existing policies, specific policies implementing data access and security, including within the DHD Data Warehouse, developed by functional areas, need to be approved by the Committee on Institutional Data Policy and Data Management to ensure consistency with the Guiding Principles, set forth in Section A, above.

          Procedures must be developed to address those cases where an individual seeks permission to access data outside of the access plan and defined roles. In those instances, the individual must submit a written request seeking non-standard access. This request should include a statement indicating the access being sought and the reason for the request, and should be submitted to the Chair of the Data Stewardship Advisory Group. The Chair will send the request to the appropriate Data Steward for review and decision. The Data Steward will report the decision to the appropriate Data Trustee and to the requestor's manager.

          Data Trustees
        </h3>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Data Trustees are senior DHD officials (typically at the level of Vice President or higher) who have planning and policy-making responsibilities for DHD data and the DHD Data Warehouse. The Data Trustees, as a group, are responsible for overseeing the establishment of data management policies and procedures, and for the assignment of data management accountability.

          Data Stewards are typically operational managers in a functional area with day-to-day responsibilities for managing business processes and establishing the business rules for the production transaction systems. Data Stewards are appointed by the respective Data Trustees. Data Steward responsibilities include the data management activities outlined in this policy and other activities that may be assigned by a Data Trustee. Data Stewards are responsible for defining the criteria for archiving data to satisfy retention requirements. Data Stewards have the responsibility to establish the processes for documenting data elements.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The Data Steward will be responsible for developing an overall data access plan. The plan should outline various roles and the access each role will have to data, including within the DHD Data Warehouse, and will seek to balance the need for information to perform one's job responsibilities and to ease administrative functionality with the need for keeping data confidential and secure. Data is categorized as Restricted, Protected, Confidential or Public, following the{" "}

          Data Steward responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

          <li>Certify published reports and analytics.</li>
          <li>Certify data reposited in the DHD Data Warehouse.</li>
          <li>Work with the Office of Institutional Research and the DHD 's Finance offices in developing definitions of commonly used terms and the algorithms for calculating DHD metrics.</li>
          <li>Participate in security access audits.</li>

        <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The Office of Institutional Research, through the role of the Chief Data Management Officer, shall be responsible for working with the appropriate Data Stewards to develop definitions of commonly used terms such as "faculty" (e.g., who is included in the count of faculty?) and "enrolled student." In addition, the Office of Institutional Research, with the appropriate Data Stewards, and using its knowledge of external reporting requirements and standards, will define how official DHD metrics are calculated (e.g., if calculating space per student, what type of space is included in the calculation [all space, academic space, etc.] and which student count is used [FTE, FT only, undergraduate, etc.].) Further, in the course of its work, the Office of Institutional Research will typically discover data discrepancies and inconsistencies and will promptly report such to the appropriate Data Steward for resolution.

          The Data Stewardship Advisory Group is a DHD - wide committee, typically composed of Data Stewards. Designated Data Users may be invited to attend, as appropriate. This group reviews the operational effectiveness of data management policies and procedures and makes recommendations to the Committee on Institutional Data Policy and Data Management for improvement or change. In addition, the Group ratifies definitions of commonly used terms and DHD metrics. The group is chaired by the Chief Data Management Officer and uses collaborative tools to foster communication and to archive the decision-making process. The Data Stewardship Advisory Group must ensure regular and appropriate collaborative communication with school-based Data Users.
